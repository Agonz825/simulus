Name Convention of Classes and Methods
======================================

Completely Hidden Classes
-------------------------

These classes should be completely hidden from the user. The user
should not even making a reference to the class objects.

The name of these classes starts with two underscores (__). All
methods and variables in the class can be named without the need to
begin with an underscore, since the class is completely hidden from
the user after all. However, there is an exception: The subclasses
from the hidden classes can be public. In that case, to avoid
confusion, the methods and variables in the hidden base classes shall
start with an underscore, unless they are to be made available to the
user.

Partially Hidden Classes
------------------------

The content of these classes should be hidden from the user. The user,
however, can get a reference to the class object (and should know what
it is). Since the content of the classes, including all variables and
methods therein, is supposed to be hidden from the user, the user
shall treat the class objects as opaque objects.

The name of these classes starts with an underscore (_). All methods
and variables in the class can be named without the need to begin with
an underscore, since the class is partially hidden from the user after
all.  However, there is an exception: The subclasses from the hidden
classes can be public. In that case, to avoid confusion, the methods
and variables in the hidden base classes shall start with an
underscore, unless they are to be made available to the user.

Public Classes
--------------

These classes are supposed to be a part of the user interface. All
public variables and methods therefore shall start without an
underscore. The hidden variables and methods, on the other hand,
should start with an underscore, to indicate that the user shall not
access them directly.
