**Simulus - A discrete-event simulator in Python**

This directory contains the source code and related materials (e.g.,
documents, tutorials, and examples) for simulus. Simulus is an
open-source discrete-event simulator in Python.

To use the simulus code in this directory, you need to simply add the
directory containing this README.md file to PYTHONPATH. Suppose your
current directory has this README.md file, and assume that you use bash;
you can run the following to set it up:

<pre>
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
</pre>

To learn using simulus, you may do the following:

1. Read and follow the documentation under the 'doc' directory
(including the jupiter notebooks)

2. Run the tests in the 'examples' directory (they should be mostly
self-explanatory)

The simulus software is free and is open source. Enjoy at your own risk!
